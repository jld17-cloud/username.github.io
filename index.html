        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Jacob, and I am a junior at Albion College. I am taking an introductory Computer Science
            course to acquire basic programming knowledge. I am also majoring in Physics, in which I have gained a solid
            baseline understanding. Moving away from my academics, I enjoy taking on new things. Around the halfway
            point of last year, I decided to build my own PC. Getting a job in a kitchen, I got the money together to
            build the pc which was a complex, yet fun experience. I have also recently gotten into 3d printing, which is
            leading me to learn about 3d modeling. I also own several beagles.
